I’m a data science graduate from General Assembly with a background in master’s educated Mine and Civil engineering with 4+ years experience in design and field engineering. Hands-on engineer who prepares estimates and determines project feasibility as well as performs surveying and support construction tasks as needed. 
Data science appeals to me as it is a way to apply my previous experience and knowledge to make meaningful and actionable insights about the world. I’m  looking for a role where I can utilise my quantitative skills in the data science field.
